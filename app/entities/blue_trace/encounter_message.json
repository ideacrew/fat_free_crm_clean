// UserID
// Validity Period (OpenTrace stores data for 21 days)

// 1. Decrypt TempID for each encounter in the uploaded encounter history
// 2. Verify each encounter timestanmp for each TempID falls within validity period
// 3. Filter for close contacts based on epidemiological parameters:
// 3.a Time of exposure: length of continous cluster of encounters
// 3.b Distance: received signal strength reading
